### SKOGSTA bench with storage shelf

A mash-up: how to convert a bench & a wall shelf into a low-slung cabinet-bench-TV stand with perfectly matching wood. [here](http://www.madewhatnow.com/SKOGSTA-bench/index.html)

### Earthquake-proof IVAR shelves: shelf lips we wish IKEA would sell 

IKEA does not sell any shelf lips that would make IVAR shelves a bit more earthquake-proof. Luckily, the OBSERVATOR cross braces can be
easily converted to a little railing, with a few simple 3D printed parts. [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4136973)

### Custom-fitted IVAR cutlery drawer

Filled a gaping hole in IKEA's sortiment: a cutlery insert that actually fits the IVAR drawer. 3D-printable. [here] (https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/20809-ikea-ivar-drawer-cutlery-organizer-flatware-tray)
