### SKOGSTA Bench with extra storage

This project is fairly quick and doesn't require woodworking skills (when using the longer SKOGSTA bench). It converts a SKOGSTA bench and (part of) a SKOGSTA wall shelf into a bench with extra storage. Useful as a shelf, cabinet or TV stand.  

Requires:
- SKOGSTA bench (47 1/4")
- SKOGSTA wall shelf (47 1/4")
- 4 small L-brackets
- various wood screws
- electric drill
- maybe some glue

This is the finished product:

## Mount the L-brackets

Forgot to take pictures here. Measure the distance from the underside of the bench top. we went with 35.5cm, as this would allow fitting the standard storage boxes and reasonable large books in there. Conveniently, at this height one of the two wall shelf boards has the exactly right widh to fit in there. Coincidence? Maybe. 

## Fix the shelf board

If your L-brackets have holes, feel free to drill/screw through them into the board. The ones we had available unfortunately hadn't, and were a bit whimpy. Putting for screws into them horizontally through the legs fixed that problem. Obviously we pre-drilled holes to prevent the legs from splitting. 

Done. Congratulations!
